# LIRI Node App
LIRI (aka Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface) is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data (like SIRI but for data/language only). LIRI can return information about concerts, movies, and music. LIRI will prompt the user to enter the following commands: concert-this, movie-this, or spotify-this-song.

## Concerts
To access information about concerts, type 'concert-this' along with a band name, and LIRI will provide a list of cities, venues, and dates. Example:
![concert-this](Images/concert-this.png)

## Movies
To access information about concerts, type 'movie-this' along with a movie name, and LIRI will provide information about the plot, year released, rating, and actors. If no movie is entered, LIRI will provide information about the movie "Mr. Nobody." Example:
![movie-this](Images/movie-this.png)

## Music
To access information about songs, type 'spotify-this-song' along with a song title, and LIRI will provide the artist, album name, and preview URL. If no song is entered, LIRI will provide information about "The Sign" by Ace of Base.  Example:
![spotify-this-song](Images/spotify-this-song.png).

## And just for fun...
Type do-what-it-says into the command line, and see what LIRI gives you.
